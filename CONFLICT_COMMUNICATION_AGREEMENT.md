# Code of Conduct

If you choose to work on this product you are still expected to follow the [Flatiron School Code of Conduct](https://flatironschool.com/code-of-conduct/).
Failure to abide by this will result in removal from the project.

#### Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it if necessary.

_Why:_
> Group projects can be stressful and emotions can run high. Put together a plan ahead of time so you all know how to deal with any potential issues later.

As a team, we are going to create a Group Agreement as a markdown file to document the following:

* What will your group do when it encounters conflict? "Talk about it on Zoom"


* What is your process to resolve conflicts? Discussion, Scoping, these could be handled in pairs or done at the standup, table things if you can't come to an agreement. "if unable to agree, we will table until afternoon (if it's morning), or next morning (if it's afternoon)


* How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful? "if something is tabled and is not resolved by standup/lunch then an instructor will solve it."

1. Tie breakers go to instructors(Lead or Coach)

#### Communication Plan

Before beginning to write code, determine how your group will communicate with each other, both in person and online.

_Why:_
> This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone knows how the group will communicate with each other and that everyone feels comfortable speaking up.

Add your communication plan to your Group Agreement. Some things to consider:

* How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend? "Just talk in slack channel (THREAD IT) and make issues use project board"
  
* What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard? "Two-a-day standups via Zoom, one in the morning, one after lunch"


* How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up? "Zoom calls twice a day at the least, plus communication via Slack.  before pushes to master, group review via Zoom.  Use AGENDA for 2-a-day standups:
1. What are you working on?
2. Your goal for the day?
3. What challenges are you running into?
"

1. Leave Comments in code explaining functionality and or bugs 
2. Consistent variable names
3. Todos in code to make squashing bugs easier to find
4. Explicit commit messages (`Added validations to forms` instead of `done`)
5. Utilize Issues, Pull requests, Project board
6. Slack channel first line of communication
